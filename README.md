# toDoApp
This is a school assignment that I did in the summer of 2020. In to do app user can add tasks and delete them when they are done. I have changed CSS stylings a bit and translated app into English. In addition to these I have added a code that makes it possible to user to add new tasks by clicking enter after writing the assignment to the input field.

Used technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.**
