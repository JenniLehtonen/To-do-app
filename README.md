# toDoApp
This is a school assignment that I did in the summer of 2020. In to do app user can add tasks and delete them when they are done.

## Technical solutions of the application
Used technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.**

I have developed this application a bit more after the summer: I have added a feature that saves the tasks to user's **local storage** so the tasks will stay in the application even though the user closes the browser. I have also changed CSS stylings a bit and translated app into English.

## Pictures of the user interface

Here you can see pictures of the user interface:

Here is the application before the user has added any tasks to it.
